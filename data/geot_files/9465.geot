that kind of thing. There is very little to no cell phone service out there. Officers take minors back to the Tom Thumb and/or GrovinNovins and call there folks, wait for them to arrive to pick them up and go get the other vehicle back at the cemetery. There are homes in this area. Be respectful on how loud you are driving the road.
