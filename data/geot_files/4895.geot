shaker village - the previous entry about the village at Pleasant Hill was entirely wrong.  The Shaker village is reportedly haunted, by many various spirits; however the idea that the Shakers drown babies is hideously wrong.  The shakers loved and cherished all the children in their community.  There are many stories of hauntings and I encourage everyone to visit this special place and find out the story of the shakers who lived there and may very well be there still.
